The _X-Posts-Code_ repository works in conjunction with Trial By Analysis (@tbanalysis) on X.

	https://x.com/tbanalysis?s=21

Every post on X is paired with a link to a file located in this repository, containing the RStudio code used to create the contents of the post.

The there are three parts to the file naming mechanism: _post number - date posted - post description_
	
	e.g., X5-11.28.24-offensive_production

Use the code in these files to try for yourself!
